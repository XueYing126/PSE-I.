Three games


1.Capitaly game
Simulate a simplified Capitaly game. There are some players with different
strategies, and a cyclical board with several fields. Players can move around the board,
by moving forward with the amount they rolled with a dice. 


2. Tricky five-in-a-row 
Two players play the game , players put their signs alternately (X and O) on the
board, If a player has five adjacent signs in a row, column or diagonal, then he wins.
The trick thing is that if a player makes 3 adjacent signs , then one of his signs is
removed randomly .Similarly, when the player makes 4 adjacent signs, two of his signs
are removed.

3.Snake
Use WASD keyboard buttons to control the movement of the snakeâ€™s head.
Red circle is food. Snake can eat food and grow up.
Black circle is rocks, If the snake collides with a rock, then the game ends.
We also lose the game, if the snake goes into itself, or into the boundary of the
game level.
