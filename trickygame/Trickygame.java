// Students’ regulation of Eötvös Loránd University (ELTE Regulations
// Vol. II. 74/C. § ) states that as long as a student presents another
// student’s work - or at least the significant part of it - as his/her own
// performance, it will count as a disciplinary fault. The most serious
// consequence of a disciplinary fault can be dismissal of the student from
// the University.
